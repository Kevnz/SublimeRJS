# SublimeRJS
###SublimeRJS makes it easier to import, remove and create modules for the RequireJS module loader.

Based on settings in a configuration file the plugin will parse your source folders and index your modules.

Importing modules is done through a quick search among the indexed modules. When selected for import the modules path as well as reference variable is automatically added to the ‘define’ statement.

Creating new modules is made easier by quick search of packages(folders), adding custom module templates and auto import of predefined modules.

SublimeRJS supports script as well as text modules.
